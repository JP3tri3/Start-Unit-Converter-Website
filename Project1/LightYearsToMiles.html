			<h4>Formula:</h4>
			<p>Miles = LightYears(5.879e+12)</p>
			<h4>History:</h4>
			<p>
				The mile is an English unit of length of linear measure equal to 5,280
				feet, or 1,760 yards, and standardised as exactly 1,609.344 metres by
				international agreement in 1959.
				<br />
				<br />
				The light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical
				distances and is equivalent to about 9.46 trillion kilometres (9.46 x
				1012 km) or 5.88 trillion miles (5.88 x 1012 mi). As defined by the
				International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance
				that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days).[2]
				Because it includes the word "year", the term light-year may be
				misinterpreted as a unit of time.
